Q: what does an electron look like?


A: first you have to define what you mean by that.  Usually when we "look at" something, some photons from a light or the sun hit the thing we want to see, then they go to our eyes, which senses the photons.  (The photons really go off in all directions, but only the lucky ones are aimed at our eyes.)


Imagine a boat in a lake.  We can splash some waves toward it, and the waves bounce off and come back.  By checking out the waves that get reflected, we can figure out how big the boat is, and the shape of its surface (at the water line).  This will also work with rocks or posts in the water - anything that the waves bounce off.


The problem is, if our boat is a small toy boat, all we can tell is that there's something there that's reflecting waves.  It shows up as a large, hazy dot.  That's because the waves are larger than the boat itself.  And so that boat will look like a rock the same size, which will look like a post of the same size.  We might not even be able to see the dot if it's too small.


The light that our eyes see are waves, and they have wavelengths of 400 to 700 nanometers, that's 4 x 10<sup>-7</sup> to 7 x 10<sup>7</sup> meters.  That's very tiny, about 20 millionths of an inch.  It's great for us humans to look at large things, and even tiny things, but anything smaller than those waves, we won't be able to see much.  An atom can be as small as 10<sup>-10</sup> meters, that's more than 1000 times smaller.  So we can't see them with light.  In fact, we can barely see them with electron microscopes.





Quantum mechanical sizes are very different from the sizes that you and I are used to.  They're so tiny, that some things we're familiar with, just doesn't happen.  For instance, there's no friction - friction comes from atoms in the two surfaces trying to bond to each other ... and then getting ripped apart.  Atoms usually bond using their electrons.  A single electron typically lives wrapped around a nucleus in an atom.  There's little or nothing to slow it down.
