------------------------------------------- done
- Emscripten engine in C - definitely
https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
Multiprocessing must be done with pThreads and/or web workers, it seems.

- test harness to run C++ integrator for testing

- OpenGL, if possible (maybe v4?)  Must be webgl cuz emscripten doesn't do full OpenGL
(basically OpenGL ES = WebGL anyway).

- vertical domain should adjust to N size
- dt should be a property of the space.  rk2test should jimmy it up.
- control panel tabs

- ability to alter speed of animation/calculation

- some diagnostics for me

- time display, frames
- time & frame num should display in real time, not via react
- after setting wave or potential, redraw!

- Fourier transforms with http://www.fftw.org to xform space domain to momentum domain

------------------------------------------- to do - between commits

- update the Copyright Date everywhere


------------------------------------------- to do - small
- small key image indicating phase-color correspondence. ?? does it  really matter?  Maybe just an explanation.

- should detect off-the-rails situations and stop frame.
	any NaNs, Infinity, or consecutive ix values that differ greatly.  Maybe calculate sum of abs of differences between consecutive psi values - and figure how whatthreshold to use.

- sliders for potential don't quite work the way i want - I think they need log and negative versions but log slider isn't ste up for that yet.

- I think it doesn't converve energy - gotta check this out.  I'm pretty certain it doesn't.  But now I have FFTs to measure it at leST.

- the potential stuff really needs a wrapper object like qWaves.  It's time.

------------------------------------------- to do - big

- potential: ability to change by hand

- UI ability to set n of dimensions, and to specify angular momentum, and any
	energy/potential differences therein.  Two particles in the same space should
	have the same X coordinates; one in 2-d space should have X  and Y coords.  The
	V potential would be 1-dimensional or 2 dimensional, depending.


- Any number of dimensions, eg x and s, the spin, becomes ψ[1...N][-½, ½] or a
	2d wave is ψ[1...N][1...N], either two 1D particles or 1 2D particle whats the
	diff?  well, the potential V with two particles, each depends on the loc of the
	other. For one particle in 2D, the potential is a 2d map.

- display Garland Spiral in 3d could be easy.  Dual waves for an electron with spin.

- ability to create two wave functions and superimpose them, with varying complex ratio between

- ability to 'stick your finger in' and measure a state variable and thereby change the state



- extensive documentation, and tooltips here and there for them.  Use MathJax and myPhysicsLab.com for docs.
