In 1900,  Max Planck figured out a formula for Blackbody Radiation.
This relates temperature to color of light.
So, for instance, if the stove is red hot, Plank's Law tells you what color of red it is, given the temperature.

Actually, the light coming out of the stove, is a smear of colors, or frequencies of waves.
Plank's law tells you how much of each frequency you'll get out, at each temperature.
(There's actually a lot more details; don't worry about that now.)

Imagine that all the stove's atoms are all connected to their neighbors with springs or guitar strings.
If you pluck one of these guitar strings, the vibration will make the atoms on each end vibrate, too.
And, those atoms will vibrate their own springs.
The vibration will spread to all the nearby atoms and springs, and from there to atoms and springs farther away.
But, the energy in the vibration spreads thin; after a while, all the atoms are  vibrating, but just a little.

Now, imagine the strings are constantly being plucked.
The atoms in the stove are jiggling around randomly.
This is called Brownian Motion.
The temperature tells you how much energy the average spring has.
The higher the temperature, the more jiggling around the atoms will do.

Now, they're really not springs, but electron orbits in the atoms in the stove burner.
And, when electrons move, they generate electromagnetic waves.
The electrons supply the electric field, and their motion provides the magnetic field (sortof).
And, electromagnetic waves are really just light.
(Also, radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays.)

So, the random vibrations generate random light, of all different frequencies (colors).
But, for a given temperature, there's a peak frequency where most of the energy goes to.
This is the color (red-hot) you see from the stove.
There's higher and lower frequencies, but the strongest is at the peak.

Your red-hot stove is maybe at 1000 degrees.  (Farenheit or Celsius, don't worry about it.)
The peak frequency is actually in the infrared, "heat rays".
If you could make your stove go hotter, the red light would get brighter.
With more heat, the color would shift to orange, and then to yellow.
(By this time, the metal and glass in your stove would be melting, the cabinets would be on fire,
and you'd be in trouble.  But, don't worry about it.)

If you could get it to 5000 or 6000 degrees (Kelvin or Celsius, or about 10,000  Farenheit)
it would be white hot; it would be giving off light over the whole rainbow, and when all the colors mix, that's white.
That's the temperature of the surface of the sun.  So, you can see, that even the sun obeys blackbody rules.

Similarly, your body, sitting in your chair, is about 300KÂ°, about room temperature.
That also gives off light, low frequency infrared light.  That light goes off and hits some other surface, keeping it warm, as that surface is also radiating infrared.
