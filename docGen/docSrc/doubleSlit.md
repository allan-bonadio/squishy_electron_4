Yes.  This is EXACTLY my understanding of how it all works.  I believe it's called the Copenhagen Interpretation (where Neils Bohr was from).

Strange and counterintuitive, if your original intuition is classical.  But, if your original intuition is Copenhagen, not counterintuitive at all 😳.

Double Slit: Electrons come out of your original electron emitter, onto the double slit panel.  Each electron has its wave, consisting of electron stuff (I call it 𝜓 or psi).  100% of each electron (= each electron's 𝜓) gets to the slit panel.  Let's say, 92% of the panel blocks, and the other 8% is the two slits, allowing 𝜓 to pass through.  So, 92% of the starting 𝜓 of ALL the electrons is blocked, and 8% of the 𝜓 of ALL the electrons, get through BOTH slits.

Looking at an individual electron, 92% probability it'll smack into the panel.  With its location now known, that's where the electron lands - 92% chance - randomly chosen, somewhere on the opaque part of the panel.  If the panel is some sort of metal electrode, that particular electron will be absorbed, and maybe, an electronic device, somewhere else in the circuit, will sense it.  Otherwise, it'll stay where it landed, and the panel will pick up some negative static electricity.

Individual electrons' waves do not interfere with other electrons' waves 🤯.  They only interfere with their own 𝜓.  The 𝜓 that gets through those two 4% slits are cut from the original 100% 𝜓 from the original beam.  Only 8% of the 𝜓 gets through, which will eventually make up 8% of the electron particles, once they hit the back wall.  And, for each electron that slips through the two slits, half of its 𝜓 goes through one slit, and the other half goes through the other slit.  We'll call these parts of the 𝜓, two 'sub-beams'.  Then, those two sub-beams interfere with each other, to make the pattern on the back wall.

You cannot tell which slit a particular electron went through, cuz it's still a wave and still split evenly between the two sub-beams.  If you used two different electron beam generators, and all of the electrons from one went to one slit, and all from the other went to the other slit, then there would be no interference pattern, cuz no electron is shared between sub-beams, and electrons cannot interfere with other electrons' 𝜓.

At the back wall, the waves' 𝜓 arrives, and the amount of each electron's 𝜓 will vary at different locations on the wall.  As you move along the wall, the distance to each of the two slits change gradually.  If the two distances are the same, the sub-beams' wave crests and troughs line up, so the 𝜓 will be full-strength there.  This is also true if the distances are off by a full wavelength, two full wavelengths, or any integer number of wavelengths.

If the distances are 1/2 wavelength off, or 3/2 or 5/2 or similar, then crests and troughs line up with each other and cancel out.  So, no 𝜓.  Distances in between will result in shades of gray (sortof).
