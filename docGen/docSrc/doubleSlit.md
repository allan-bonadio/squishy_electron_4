Yes.  This is EXACTLY my understanding of how it all works.  I believe it's called the Copenhagen Interpretation (where Neils Bohr was from).

Strange and counterintuitive, if your original intuition is classical.  But, if your original intuition is Copenhagen, not counterintuitive at all 😳.

Double Slit: Electrons come out of your original electron emitter, onto the double slit panel.  Each electron has its wave, consisting of electron stuff (I call it 𝜓 or psi).  100% of each electron (= each electron's 𝜓) gets to the slit panel.  Let's say, 92% of the panel blocks, and the other 8% is the two slits, allowing 𝜓 to pass through.  So, 92% of the starting 𝜓 of ALL the electrons is blocked, and 8% of the 𝜓 of ALL the electrons, get through BOTH slits.

Looking at an individual electron, 92% probability it'll smack into the panel.  With its location now known, that's where the electron lands - 92% chance - randomly chosen, somewhere on the opaque part of the panel.  If the panel is some sort of metal electrode, that particular electron will be absorbed, and maybe, an electronic device, somewhere else in the circuit, will sense it.  Otherwise, it'll stay where it landed, and the panel will pick up some negative static electricity.

Individual electrons' waves do not interfere with other electrons' waves 🤯.  They only interfere with their own 𝜓.  The 𝜓 that gets through those two 4% slits are cut from the original 100% 𝜓 from the original beam.  Only 8% of the 𝜓 gets through, which will eventually make up 8% of the electron particles, once they hit the back wall.  And, for each electron that slips through the two slits, half of its 𝜓 goes through one slit, and the other half goes through the other slit.  We'll call these parts of the 𝜓, two 'sub-beams'.  Then, those two sub-beams interfere with each other, to make the pattern on the back wall.

You cannot tell which slit a particular electron went through, cuz it's still a wave and still split evenly between the two sub-beams.  If you used two different electron beam generators, and all of the electrons from one went to one slit, and all from the other went to the other slit, then there would be no interference pattern, cuz no electron is shared between sub-beams, and electrons cannot interfere with other electrons' 𝜓.

At the back wall, the waves' 𝜓 arrives, and the amount of each electron's 𝜓 will vary at different locations on the wall.  As you move along the wall, the distance to each of the two slits change gradually.  If the two distances are the same, the sub-beams' wave crests and troughs line up, so the 𝜓 will be full-strength there.  This is also true if the distances are off by a full wavelength, two full wavelengths, or any integer number of wavelengths.

If the distances are 1/2 wavelength off, or 3/2 or 5/2 or similar, then crests and troughs line up with each other and cancel out.  So, no 𝜓.  Distances in between will result in shades of gray (sortof).



================================


When the light comes out of the laser, it's monochromatic, and coherent.  In other words, the photons exist in a momentum eigenstate.  Waves.  This (these) eigenstates are superpositions of all of the location eigenstates.  Wave function of the light is like cos(x) + i sin(x) for all x.  (circularly polarized.... freq and magnitude set to 1 for simplicity.)  So, they seem to us as waves.

When they hit the back wall, they have to have definite location - you're 'measuring' the location, it's the location of the back wall.  Or, specifically, they have to exist in a location eigenstate, a superposition of momentum eigenstates, each with a phase that makes all the wave functions peak exactly at the location of the backwall.  Everywhere else they cancel out, so the photon is now at that location.

And, the probability of the photon as a wave, being in the location at the backwall, depends on the dotproduct of the eigenstates before and after.  That's the Copenhagen interpretation.  Neils Bohr.

So, Huygen's principle says that the wave travels as though every location it comes from, broadcasts in all directions.  When it's the single laser beam with thickness,  it goes straight ahead, because that's the only way the wave's peaks and troughs, from the left side of the beam and the right, and all places in between, can line up.  At any other angle, the light from across the width, will be traveling at different phases.  Kindof a smear, and they'll all cancel out.

But if they go through a slit, there (theoretically) is no width, so the waves can come out in a circular pattern.  For each photon, some of it goes through the one slit, some through the other slit, and most of it is absorbed (or whatever) on the back of your two-slit mask thing.

Quantum waves can only interfere with themselves (from the same particle), so if you lit the two slits with different lights, it wouldn't work.  The small fraction of the photon that makes it through the two slits, can now form semicircular waves and interfere on the back wall.  But, all randomly and probabilistically, depending on the magnitude of the wave function (after all the additions and subtractions because of phase and interfererence.
