This is a list of words in the rest of the documentation that I think I can define.
This is not exhaustive, and I don't know your level of education or understanding,
so I don't even know what you need to know.  I'm guessing.  If I'm missing words,
drop me an email.

**A**

**B**

**C**

**D**

**E**

electron - a tiny particle.  This is what's simulated in Squishy Electron.
It's got an electric charge, so it gets attracted to protons and repelled by other electrons.

Energy - the ability to do work.  It's a number and a quantity of Joules or kilowatt hours or BTUs.
We measure energy in pfg nm¬≤ / ps¬≤

eV - electron volt - the energy needed to push an electron up a voltage of 1 volt.

**F**

femto- a prefix that means one quadrillionth.  (15 decimal places)

**G**

gram - a unit of mass.  About the mass of a big pill.  A US penny is about 3 grams.

**H**

**I**

imaginary numbers - a formal mathematical term for numbers that are kindof perpendicular
to regular numbers ('real' numbers).
They're not really imaginary

integers - whole numbers, positive, negative or zero.  ‚Öì is not an integer, neither is œÄ.

**J**

**K**

kilo- - a prefix that means 1000.  So a kilogram is 1000 grams.

**L**

**M**

mass - like weight, but different.  Weight is a force, whereas Mass is an amount of matter.
If you have a 6 pound suitcase on earth, on the moon it'll be only 1 pound -
that's because pounds measure weight, not mass.
The gravity on the moon is 1/6 of the gravity on earth.
If your suitcase is 3 kilograms (about the same) on earth, it'll be 3 kilograms on the moon or out in space.  Mass doesn't depend on gravity.

Mega- - a prefix that means a million.
A megabyte is one million bytes.

meter - a unit of length, longer than a yard.

micro ¬µ = one millionth.  So a microgram is 1/1000000 of a gram.  (6 decimal places)

milli - A prefix that means one thousandth.
So a milligram is 1/1000 of a gram, and a millimeter is 1/1000 of a meter.

millipsi or milliùúì - a unit that represents 1/1000 of the particle or its probability.
See also ùúì.  It's really a pure number, but sometimes sit's handy to have a unit for it,
usually applied to datapoints in the wave.

**N**

nano - prefix means one-billionth.   (9 decimal places)

nanosecond - one billionth of a second.
Light travels one foot in a nanosecond.

nanometer - a tiny unit of length.  A strand of human DNA  is 2.5 nanometers in diameter.
Typical atoms are about 1/10 of a nanometer.

**O**

quantum - a whole unit of something.
If you have a fishbowl full of marbles, the number of marbles is quantized.
You can have 3081 marbles, or 3082 marbles, but not 3081.5 marbles.
Your quantum size is 1 marble.
Water, for example, is not quantized.

**P**

pfg - a unit of mass.  A pico femto gram, one billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a gram,
about the mass of an electron (really tiny).

pico- - prefix means one trillionth

picosecond - a tiny unit of time.  One trillionth of a second.

pound (lb) - a unit of weight.
Used mostly in the US; the rest of the world has graduated to kilograms.

proton - a particle that's positively charged.  Hydrogen atoms have a proton in the center.

ùúì - psi (greek letter) pronounced 'psi' - The wave.
Complex valued, one for each state (or location) of a particle.
Also, as a unit, the integration of ùúì* ùúì everywhere, which should be 1.

**Q**

**R**

real numbers - a formal mathematical term for numbers that includes positive, negative and fractional numbers (and zero).
Numbers are abstractions, so you cannot have a 'real' number without the number applying to something.
So you cannot hold 3 in your hand, but you can hold 3 marbles in your hand.

**S**

**T**

**U**

**V**

volt - a unit of voltage

voltage - electrical pressure.  An electron, being negatively charged, will gravitate to higher voltages.
Voltage is a property of a place, and often, a wire.  Places along a wire will all have the same voltage.


**W**

weight - a force that an object has from gravity.  In space, in orbit, all weights go to  zero.
That's why they call it 'weightless'.  But, mass doesn't change.

**X**

**Y**

**Z**

**other**

ùúì - greek letter psi, stands for the wave function.  A list of complex numbers (real and imaginary parts), one for each point in the wave

œÄ - greek letter pi, just like you learned in school: 3.14159265...  Don't worry about all the digits after 3.14, you won't need them.  A circle has a circumference of œÄd, where d is the diameter of the circle (how wide) or 2œÄr where r the radius, the distance to the center of the circle (half the diameter).
