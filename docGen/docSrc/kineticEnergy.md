Kinetic Energy is the energy a particle has because of its velocity, it's speed.  The faster it's going, the more kinetic energy it has.  Usually, you can figure

$K = 1/2 m v^2$

<p>As it rolls uphill and gains altitude, that kinetic energy will be converted to <a href=voltageEnergy.html>Potential Energy</a>.
