## Waves in Nature

Many things in nature vibrate.  Many other things go in a circle.
You might think that these things bang violently from one side to another, but, really, they follow a gentle sine wave.
The way we describe these things mathematically is with trig functions: sine and cosine.

Sine and cosine are a quarter circle apart (or π/2 or 90°).
You need both of them, for instance, for going in a circle.
The sine can be up-down, and the cosine can be left-right.

With a guitar string, some guitar player pulls on a string and then lets go.
When they let go, the string is coasting through the air, and it's following the laws of nature.

So, first, think about the position of the string; where it is sideways, how far from its middle position.
Of course, it's vibrating back and forth.
Over time, the position follows a sine wave, back and forth.
We can call the middle position 0, and each side –1 and +1.

Next, think of the speed that the string is moving sideways.
It's stopped when it's at the ends, positioins –1 and +1; about to go the other way.
It's moving fastest when the string passes the middle the zero position.
So, this is kind of like the opposite: the speed is -1 or 1 when the position is zero.
The speed is zero when the position is at -1 or 1.
So, this isn't the sine, it's the cosine, 90° off.
The derivative, rate of change,of the position is cosine.

Now, think of the force that the sting uses to bring it back to the middle, overshoot to the other end, and back again.  It's proportional to the (slight) curvature of the string, at that time.  So, just like the position, it's a sine wave.  But notice how, when the string is up, the force pushes down.  And, when the string is down, the force pushes up.

The curvature, mathematically, is the 'second derivative'.
The derivative is the rate of change.
The second derivative is the rate of change of the rate of change.
And, the force always overshoots.  So, the string swings to the other side.

And as soon as they're on the other side, the same forces work to push the string back.
Immediately, these forces pushing back, get a little bit smaller.
And, every fraction of a second, they get a little bit smaller still.
These forces actually follow a sine wave over time.
And, the rate of change over time follows a sine wave.


that go back and forth, follow a sine curve.
A tree branch being blown in the wind will go back and forth.
bleah.

Vibrations in the air also follow a sine wave.

What's so special about a sine wave?
