So, how does an atom work?
The electrons have the same basic properties,
but they're all attracted to the protons in the nucleus.
They have a fuzzy wave packet; but the packet is circling the nucleus endlessly.
This is called an **electron shell**.
In order to be stable, there has to be a whole number of cycles around
the circumference of the orbit; zero cycles for ground-state hydrogen or
helium, 1 cycle for the second and third rows of the periodic table, and
2 cycles for the fourth and fifth row.
This is where the word **quantum** comes from;
the wavelength has to be quantized - a whole number of waves, with no fractions.

It's
(more complicated)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration].
Atoms have multiple electron _shells_, one for each row in the diagram.
Then, each shell has multiple _subshells_, each a color band, in the shell, in the row, in the diagram.
Take the odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7.  Now double them: 2, 6, 10, 14

- S subshells have up to 2 electrons (1 × 2)
- P subshells have up to 6 electrons (3 × 2)
- D subshells have up to 10 electrons (5 × 2)
- F subshells have up to 14 electrons (7 × 2)

The letters S, P, D and F are old, and they're now meaningless.
But they're kept around because everybody knows them (and now, you do too).

So, the first element, Hydrogen, has only one electron, in its only S sub-shell, in its only shell.
Right after that comes Helium, two electrons in its S sub-shell, and first shell.
The Sun is almost all Hydrogen and Helium.

Then, oxygen #8, second row, has two S sub-shells, four electrons, and then one P sub-shell that isn't filled, for another 4.
Total 8.
This is the oxygen we breathe.

And, Kryptonite (#36 on the right) has 4 shells, all together having:
- four S sub-shells (8 electrons) in red,
- three P sub-shells (18 electrons) in yellow,
- and one D sub-shell (10 electrons) in blue

for a total of 36 electrons.

As you move towards the right on the chart, each atom has one more electron than the previous one to the left.
Each new electron is added to the innermost sub-shells in the outermost shell, because all of the lower shells and sub-shells are filled.

Actually, it's even more complicated.
The arrangement of electrons changes, as it gets more energy or links to other atoms to make compounds.
Each element has an atomic number, which is really the number of protons, like 36 for Krypton.
The number of protons usually stays the same, but the number of electrons can change,
mostly for chemical bonds, but also when you pump more energy into the atom.
So, for instance, in water H₂O, the Oxygen has 8 electrons normally, but it shares four electrons with the two hydrogen atoms.
Two come from the Oxygen, and one each from the Hydrogens.

You see, the goal for each atom is to complete the electrons in each shell.
So, the Oxygen can pretend it has 10 electrons, and each Hydrogen can pretend it's got 2 electrons.
