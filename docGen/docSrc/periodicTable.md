an electron circling its nucleus

So, how does an atom work?
The electrons have the same basic properties,
but they're all attracted to the protons in the nucleus.
They have a fuzzy wave packet; but the packet is circling the nucleus endlessly.
This is called an **electron shell**.
In order to be stable, there has to be a whole number of cycles around
the circumference of the orbit; zero cycles for ground-state hydrogen or
helium, 1 cycle for the second and third rows of the periodic table, and
2 cycles for the fourth and fifth row.
This is where the word **quantum** comes from;
the wavelength has to be quantized - a whole number of waves, with no fractions.

Actually, it's more complicated.  Atoms have multiple electron _shells_, one for each row in the diagram.
Then, each shell has multiple _subshells_, each a color band, in the shell, in the row, in the diagram.

So, Kryptonite (#36) has 4 shells, having:
- four S subshells,
- three P subshells,
- and one D subshell,

for a total of 36 electrons.

- S subshells have up to 2 electrons (1 × 2)
- P subshells have up to 6 electrons (3 × 2)
- D subshells have up to 10 electrons (5 × 2)
- F subshells have up to 14 electrons (7 × 2)

As you move towards the right on the chart, each atom has one more electron than the previous one to the left.
Each new electron is added to the innermost subshell in the outermost shell, because all of the lower subshells are filled.

Actually, it's even more complicated.  
Each element has an atomic number, which is sortof the number of electrons, like 36 for Krypton.  
Actually, its the number of protons in the nucleus.
The number of protons usually stays the same, but the numbers of electrons change, mostly for chemical bonds.
So, for instance, water H2O, the Oxygen has 8 electrons normally.  

If you stick two Hydrogen atoms on, the Oxygen atom can borrow the two electrons from the two Hydrogen atoms,
so it can think it's got 10.  It's happier that way.
