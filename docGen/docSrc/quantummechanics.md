description: Explains what Quantum Mechanics

Quantum Mechanics is what they call the physics of very small things.

It's actually a bad name for the concept.  The first branch of physics that anybody studied was just about things moving around, and also, things NOT moving around, and why.

Ancient Greeks like Aristotle, the Pythagoreans, Ctesibius, and Archimedes argued over things like whether a vacuum could exist or not.  There's a limit to what these early physicist could do; back then, things that were 'fast' were like a fast horse.  Flat surfaces were always lumpy, so they couldn't visualize any place that had no friction.  Things that flew through the air would go for a while, and drop, unless they were birds.  They thought that that a physical rule of nature.

During the middle ages, islamic thinkers like al-Biruni, Ibn Bajja, and Abu'l-Barakāt started questioning Aristotle, because some of his ideas were pretty primitive.  Although, Europe used it as scientific fact.  They also pondered coordinates, forces, motion and intertia.  During the Renaissance in Europe, Huygens, Leibniz, and, especially, Galileo and Newton began understanding gravity, friction and some of the actual laws of motion.

Electricity and Magnetism (they are related) was the next big area of physics, studied by Greeks and Romans like Euclid, Pliny and Ptolemy.  Back then, electricity, magnetism and light were thought of as separate things.  In the middle ages, al-Haytham,  Shen Kuo, and Cardano worked on these topics.  During the Renaissance, Kepler, Benjamin Franklin, Galvani, and Volta continued this work.  In the 1800s, Ørsted and Ampère proved that electric currents produce a magnetic field.  Faraday proved that moving magnets produced an electrical current.  And Maxwell's Equations showed that electric and magnetic forces have a complementary, mirror-like relationship between them.  He showed that the equations could describe waves that traveled at the speed of light, thereby proving that light was electromagnetic.

In all of that, mechanics was seen as fundamental bedrock, and electromagnetism was a layer above it.  So, when they learned about quantum, it was natural to call the bedrock of quantum Quantum Mechanics.  But, basic quantum is really more about simple existence, and the state that systems are in, which is so different from the rules everybody learns as a child — so fundamental, that you can't even list scientists who figured them out.





Quantum came about from the early days, when it turned out that light (now understood to be individual particles) would only be emitted by an atom at certain energy amounts (colors).  In fact, the atom had a list of energy levels it could be in, and the photons would always have an amount of energy that was the difference between any two levels.  These were not equally spaced, which made it harder to tease out what was really happening.  These levels were not equally spaced, like you might think.  Instead, they were like 1, ¼, ¹⁄₉, ¹⁄₁₆, basically 1/n² where n is 0, 1, 2, ....  So you might have a photon come out that had an energy of ¹⁄₉ – ¹⁄₁₆, which is ⁷⁄₁₄₄.  Not very quantum-like.  But, other quantities were, like the angular momentum of an orbit, at ℏ, 2ℏ, 3ℏ, ....  And, ultimately, when they found ways for electrons to be created and destroyed, that even the number of electrons is a quantum number.  You cannot have 3½ electrons.  Things get more complicated after that.
