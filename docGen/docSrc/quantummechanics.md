description: Explains what Quantum Mechanics

Quantum Mechanics is what they call the physics of very small things.

It's actually a bad name for the concept.  The first branch of physics that anybody studied was just about things moving around, and also, things NOT moving around, and why.

Ancient Greeks like Aristotle, the Pythagoreans, Ctesibius, and Archimedes argued over things like whether a vacuum could exist or not.  There's a limit to what these early physicist could do; back then, things that were 'fast' were like a fast horse.  Flat surfaces were always lumpy, so they couldn't visualize any place that had no friction.  Things that flew through the air would go for a while, and drop, unless they were birds.  They thought that that a physical rule of nature.

During the middle ages, islamic thinkers like al-Biruni, Ibn Bajja, and Abu'l-Barakāt started questioning Aristotle, because some of his ideas were pretty primitive.  Although, Europe used it as scientific fact.  They also pondered coordinates, forces, motion and intertia.  During the Renaissance in Europe, Huygens, Leibniz, and, especially, Galileo and Newton began understanding gravity, friction and some of the actual laws of motion.

Electricity and Magnetism (they are related) was the next big area of physics, studied by Greeks and Romans like Euclid, Pliny and Ptolemy.  Back then, electricity, magnetism and light were thought of as separate things.  In the middle ages, al-Haytham,  Shen Kuo, and Cardano worked on these topics.  During the Renaissance, Kepler, Benjamin Franklin, Galvani, and Volta continued this work.  In the 1800s, Ørsted and Ampère proved that electric currents produce a magnetic field.  Faraday proved that moving magnets produced an electrical current.  And Maxwell's Equations showed that electric and magnetic forces have a complementary, mirror-like relationship between them.  He showed that the equations could describe waves that traveled at the speed of light, thereby proving that light was electromagnetic.

In all of that, mechanics was seen as fundamental bedrock, and electromagnetism was a layer above it.  So, when they learned about quantum, it was natural to call the bedrock of quantum Quantum Mechanics.  But, basic quantum is really more about simple existence, and the state that systems are in, which is so different from the rules everybody learns as a child — so fundamental, that you can't even list scientists who figured them out.





Quantum came about from the early days, when it turned out that light (now understood to be individual particles) would only be emitted by an atom at certain energy amounts (colors).  In fact, the atom had a list of energy levels it could be in, and the photons would always have an amount of energy that was the difference between any two levels.  These were not equally spaced, which made it harder to tease out what was really happening.  These levels were not equally spaced, like you might think.  Instead, they were like 1, ¼, ¹⁄₉, ¹⁄₁₆, basically 1/n² where n is 0, 1, 2, ....  So you might have a photon come out that had an energy of ¹⁄₉ – ¹⁄₁₆, which is ⁷⁄₁₄₄.  Not very quantum-like.  But, other quantities were, like the angular momentum of an orbit, at ℏ, 2ℏ, 3ℏ, ....  And, ultimately, when they found ways for electrons to be created and destroyed, that even the number of electrons is a quantum number.  You cannot have 3½ electrons.  Things get more complicated after that.

A particle wave  only interferes with itself.  (that's my interpretation, what I was taught.)  For instance, if you take two lights, their light can't interfere with each other.  But, if you take one and run it through two slits, the same wave from the same single photon particle, can go through the two slits and interfere with itself on the other side, with that pattern.

By the Copenhagen interpretation, each particle coming off your piece of uranium (or whatever) in the cloud chamber starts out with a wave that's spherical (except it was probably emitted from one side, so it's really asymmetric - maybe different from your description, not sure).  That state is a superposition of eigenstates for each possible location and each possible momentum it can have.  They interfere so that all states of different locations or velocities cancel out, and only the spherical wave is present.

As soon as a line in the cloud chamber starts, whatever interaction caused that to happen (collision with an alcohol molecule?), changes the alpha particle's state and wave.  This is the collapse.  It is now a superposition of states that interferes so that only the state(s) representing that alpha particle at that location, moving in that velocity, are left.  All other states interfere with each other to vanish.

And, actually, each bubble in that line happens because of another interaction with the next alcohol molecule, cutting the Alpha momentum down a little bit, that's taken off by the alcohol molecule, which soon collides into nearby alcohol molecules, causing a sortof heat bubble, which shows up as part of that line.  (I think, not exactly sure how those bubble chambers work.)  The alpha particle continues off in the same line because it has enough momentum (MeV or keV) to blow away all the alcohol molecules in its way.

If that alpha particle, later, hits something else that's big, and scatters off into all directions, its state again changes, into one like the first above.

So all these states are superpositions of eigenstates.  You can choose your basis of eigenstates to be each possible combination of location and momentum, or each possible sphere traveling outward, or any other basis.  Just like, in 3d space, you can choose your basis of x y z coordinates to be East, South and Up, or South, West, Down, or any such combination, or any alternative rotated at any angle from those.  These vectors can all be described with 3 real numbers in a vector, and you can rotate or distort them linearly with a matrix, using matrix multiplication.  A vector like (5, 7, 9).

Quantum states, though, are ∞-dimensional vectors, with complex numbers in each slot.  Similar math, vastly different concept.  Each component represents the wave function component for an eigenstate you chose (you did choose one, right?).  Since there's an ∞ number of location eigenstates, even between two locations, we use complex-valued functions, like 𝜓(x) instead of matrices or vectors.  This is the wave function, and, at each point, you can find the probability of finding the alpha particle there, with 𝜓*⋅𝜓, you multiply 𝜓 with its complex conjugate, same as the absolute value squared.
