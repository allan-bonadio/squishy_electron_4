<p>
I was a physics major in school.
Like many students, I had trouble grasping quantum mechanics.
The way the particles behaved just seemed so unintuitive.

<p>
Then, I realized, maybe this is not a physics problem; it's a psychology problem.
I don't have an intuitive idea of how quantum works, because I didn't have any quantum toys.
Like any other child, I had toys made of metal, plastic, fabric, wood.
My life also involved food, porcelain, glass, water, linoleum, carpet, grass, and other macroscopic materials and things.
And, like any other child, I fingered them and put them in my mouth, because I was curious about them.
As an adult, I can intuitively visualize how they'll behave.
I know that if I grab at some grass, and pull, I'll pull out some shreds of grass;
whereas, if I try that with carpeting, it won't rip out.

<p>
But, I never had a chance to play with microscopic particles.
And I'm trying to understand what they're like; what they "feel" like,
how they behave when you push them around with your fingers.
That's what I'm trying to do with this project.
I called it "Squishy Electron".

<p>
This project is barely at alpha-level.
But, here's a screen recording of a wave packet trying to move to the right.
The colors show you the complex phase of œà.
The height tells you the probability of the electron being at that location.
It's upside down intentionally.

<p>

It is correct that a wave packet will  spread out as it travels across.
(So much for the idea that an electron is like a tiny marble.)
As <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle>Heisenberg</a> said,

<p>
ùö´<var>x</var> ùö´<var>p</var> ‚â• <span>‚Ñè<br>&mdash;<br>2</span>

<p>
If you nail down the <var>x</var> coordinate to a narrow span, then the momentum <var>p</var>,
and therefore velocity, ends up being very uncertain, so the wave packet spreads out as it travels
(or even if it stands still).
Normally, these electrons are caught in the electric field of a nucleus,
which keeps them in one place (within a nanometer).
In this case, the electron is in free space, so it stretches out like a crowd of children.

<p>You can see that the rainbow pattern advances to the right,
this is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_velocity>phase velocity</a>
The packet itself also moves to the right, more quickly.
This is called the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_velocity>group velocity</a>

<p>
The space wraps around,
so all wavelengths are integer fractions of the length of the space.
I've got some problems with harmonics, and it's pretty low resolution now.

<p>
The integration is done in C++, on the browser side, with <a href=https://emscripten.org>emscripten</a>,
which is based on WebAssembly, a system that can run compiled languages in the browser.
It can do thousands of integration steps per second.
This stuff happens behind the scenes,
and I don't have a good debugger into the running emscripten code working yet.
When I started this project,
I didn't realize how much C++ and numerical programming I'd have to do;
haven't had much time to work on the JS and ui.
I've got quite a few unit tests in there;
they run as native C++, so debugging is much easier.

<p>
The graphics is done with WebGL, partly because it's so easy to get a gradient,
also because I plan to do some 3d, like with the Ant project.
Right now it's in WebGL 1, planning on migrating to WebGL 2.
