Waves
=======================

Waves are vibrations that are moving in space.

Vibrations are things that are moving in a cycle, over time.  Most people think of vibrations as things moving fast, like a tuning fork or a guitar string.  But, you can think of other things as vibrations: a child swinging back and forth on a swing is vibrating.  All vibrations have a cycle time; for a child on a swing, it's probably about one or two seconds.  For a tuning fork, it might be 1/100 or 1/1000 of a second.

Guitar strings generate sound waves.  The string, as it moves back and forth, pushes on the air around it - first, to the left, and then to the right.  The air near the string needs to push some other air to make room for it.  Then, the air next to that air, gets pushed in turn.  And, this continues on until the air in your ears get pushed, and you hear a sound.


The air is springy and elastic, so these waves travel.


transverse waves
longitudinal wave  - what's the word for inline waves again?

well, quantum waves aren't like either of these cuz they vibrate along in complex space.
