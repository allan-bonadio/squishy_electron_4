This project is like, pre-alpha quality.  sorry.
It has hardwired file paths that I've created identically on my machines.

====================================================== Dec 2022

tweaking CRA config:
https://marmelab.com/blog/2021/07/22/cra-webpack-no-eject.html

make a general purpose binary object identifier function

====================================================== Dec 2022
Browser availability for important features I use:

WebGL 1: most browsers 2010 thru 2016, android maybe 2016

WebGL 2: chrome & firefox Jan '17, Safari (both) & Edge 2020-2021

WebGL 2 if you enable experimental features: Chrome & Safari 2015-2017

WebAssembly: most browsers 2017, on android maybe 2018

WebWorkers:
safari & Firefox & Chrome 2009 to early 2010
Edge July 2015
Safari ios 2012
Android 2013 - 2022

in general, Android browsers lag the rest, although I'm not sure which browsers they use.  Maybe Chrome, then Samsung, then Edge then Firefox.

need to update code for this.

for some streamlining; by adding a Mime type and .gz

v3 refers to the previous SquishyElectron project.
v4 is squishy_electron_4, this project.

------------------------------------------------ Spaces and Waves

This is aspirational, or maybe just the description of the quantum engine.

- a 'dimension' is a description of one of the state variable sets that index a wave.
class qDimension {
	continuum: contWELL or contENDLESS (has N+2 values for N possibilities)
		or contDISCRETE (has N values for N possibilities)
	N: possible QM states.  Always a power of 2 for non-discrete dimensions.
	nPoints: number of values (=N or N+2) times nPoints for lower-numbered dimensions
	nStates: number of states (N) times nStates for lower-numbered dimensions
	label: 'x', 'y' or 'z' or other; C string
		two particles will have x1, x2 but one in 2d will have x, y.
			Spin: Sz, or Sz1, Sz2, ...  Smax = 2S+1.  Sz= ix - S.  Orbital Ang: Lz, combined: Jz
			variable total angular mom: L combines Lz and Ltot so: state ix = 0...Lmax^2
			Ltot = floor(sqrt(ix))   Lz = ix - L(L+1) and you have to choose a Lmax sorry
			Also could have Energy dimensions...
}
Each dimension's variable is an integer, either 0...N-1 or 1...N, the latter for contWELL or contENDLESS.
	Coordinates always have 1 extra point on each end, either for ‚àû wall or for wraparound

- a 'Space' is a list of dimensions, and a potential function of those dimension variables
	Dimensions are listed from outer to inner as with the resulting psi array:
	psi[outermost-dim][dim][dim][innermost-dim]
	As fo present writing, only does one dimension
	class Space {
		qDimension dimensions[];
		Avatar, one or more.  manages iteration and display
		potential (array of state variables often denoted V);
		Waves, one or more
	}

- a 'Wave' is a multidimensional array of psi  values, each a complex number (two floats, usually double)
	- qWave is a quantum system state
	- qSpectrum is an FFT of a qWave
	- qBuffer is the superclass of the above two
	- qBuffer points to space it's designed for; all buffers are freed when space changes dimensions so they can be recreated
	- iterate passes thru all psi values along all dimensions
	- fixBoundaries() automatically wraps continuum dimensions
	- can have multiple waves per space; user can superimpose them (someday)


Also must have shared between JS and C++:
- animation period
- potential energy as function of state; scalars not complex
- elapsed time; frame number
- all things in the control panel
- just lots of others

Also must have in C++; not sure if JS cares:
- progress of each thread, so it can coordinate the threads
someday

------------------------------------------------ equations

ih ‚àÇœà / ‚àÇt  =  [V - (h^2/2m) (‚àÇ^2/‚àÇx^2)] œà


ih ‚àÇpsi / ‚àÇt  =  V psi - (h^2/2m) (‚àÇ^2/‚àÇx^2) psi

where t=time, x=location (potentially scalar, 2-vec or 3-vec)
h=hbar ƒß plank's constant / 2œÄ   m=particle (electron) mass
V=potential, function of x (and t maybe someday)
psi œà is the wave function itself, a complex function of x and t.  Both of those are discretized: dx=1 always, and dt is variable




------------------------------------------------ wish list


- UI ability to set n of dimensions, and to specify angular momentum, and any energy/potential differences therein.  Two particles in the same space should have the same X coordinates; one in 2-d space should have X  and Y coords.  The V potential would be 1-dimensional or 2 dimensional, depending.
Any number of dimensions, eg x and s, the spin, becomes œà[1...N][-¬Ω, ¬Ω]
or a 2d wave is œà[1...N][1...N], either two 1D particles or 1 2D particle
whats the diff?  well, the potential V with two particles, each depends on the loc of the other.
For one particle in 2D, the potential is a 2d map.

- Multiprocessing must be done with web workers, with atomics synchronizing.  Multiple threads working on successive generations; dual threads on Re and Im.

- display Spiral in 3d could be easy.  Dual waves for an electron with spin?

- ability to create two wave functions and superimpose them, with varying complex ratio between

- ability to 'stick your finger in' and measure a state variable and thereby change the state

- small key table indicating phase-color correspondence (see that file... i think in resume directory)


================================================================ emscripten

Follow the directions on this page to install it, into /opt/dvl/emscripten:

https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

then from the top level run this:
quantumEngine/building/genExports.js

go change that file as you add more C++ exports you want to call from JS.

-------------------- node and python

I had to upgrade my Python to 3.9.5, otherwise the 'install' wouldn't work.  And then, add the 'certificates'.

I think it installs its own version of Python 3.9.2 (after I installed 3.9.5), and also its own version of node 14.15.5, which I also already have installed with nvm.  Should figure out a way to better coexist with that someday.

oh yeah, here:
emsdk uninstall node-14.15.5-64bit
emsdk uninstall python-3.9.2-1-64bit

get the installed version numbers:
./emsdk list

----------------------

this is automatically done in the build scripts so you don't have to put them into your .profile or whatever files:

. /opt/dvl/emscripten/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh

# according to informal benchmarks run June 5, 2021, the C++
# version of RK2 is 5x or 6x faster than the JS version.  ha.
# not even using rk2 anymore
