"What are you trying to do?", said the professor.

<p>I was in the 'computer room' in Upson Hall, at college.  The Computer wasn't actually there; it was out "by the airport".  Years before, student Vietnam war protesters had taken over a few buildings in a nationally televised, several-day incident.  The Computer was very expensive, so they figured that it would be safer out there.  I'd never been to that airport; I got to school by greyhound bus or car.

<p>There were four places on campus where you could submit your deck of computer cards, all somehow wired to The Computer, out at the airport.  Each was a 'computer room'.  You stand in line to load your deck, then wait by the line printer for your program to run.  You got 1 second of computer time on The Computer, an IBM mainframe.  The printer was tearing away, seemingly very fast for the times, cranking out page after page with a searing crackle that filled the room, as if it was tearing apart pages of paper several times a second.  The printer's paper came from a box of 'fan-folded' paper; it was all one long sheet of paper, folded back and forth like Zs, with perforations between the pages, where you'd tear your printout off from the persons' before and after you.  The paper had sprocket holes on each side that the printer used to grip the paper as it raced through the machine.

<p>Far from a typewriter, it printed whole lines of text at a time; that's why it was called a 'line' printer.  It used metal strips of type with all the letters, digits and punctuation, zipping left to right, with hammers timed just right to print the right glyph at the right place.  It had a ribbon of ink, like a typewriter, but it was as wide as your hand and ran diagonally between the type and the paper, rolling a bit from one big spool to another, every time a line was printed.

<p>The professor was waiting by the printer, along with me, and a handful of other users, each of us waiting for a page that had our name on it, to come grinding out.  The printer had a window where you could see each page getting printed, before flying out the back in a blur, and piling up in the same Z-fold pattern it was in before being grabbed into the printer by its sprocket holes.

<p>"I'm trying to integrate Schrodinger's Equation" I said sheepishly to the professor.  "Integrate" wasn't really the right word; it was a set of Ordinary Differential Equations that were a level or two more complex than plain-old integration, which you learn in Calculus class.  But everybody called it 'integration' because it's similar and nobody can come up with a better word for solving ODEs.

<p>"Oh," the professor said with a chuckle, "you can't integrate Schrodinger's equation with just one second of computer time."  I'd had him for one class that wasn't quantum mechanics; but of course, he's a physics professor; he knows quantum.  They all know quantum.

<p>I was bummed.  I was learning quantum mechanics that semester; a whole new world I didn't even know existed before college.  A world of excruciatingly tiny mechanics.  And, it just seemed so amorphous.  I could visualize a bicycle rolling down a hill, or a cannon ball flying through the air, or billiard balls smacking against each other and going in different directions.

<p>With classical mechanics (which I was also learning that semester), you could simulate the whole solar system; all 9 planets (back then), around the sun, with a relatively simple program (which I'd already done).  Each was 1 rock, and you could pretend they had a tiny size, all their material concentrated into a grain of sand where the middle was.  It was proven in class that you could do that approximation with the sun; the result was almost exactly the same as tediously calculating each spoonful of sun, with its location, composition, and type of crystaline structure.

<p>But, with quantum mechanics, you had to throw out the concept of a hard object with a definite surface and location.  These cartoon images that one sees of an atom are really baloney.  You see a bunch of billiard balls stuck together as a nucleus, with smaller marbles circling around in oval paths... No.  Each particle is more like a cloud, a hazy blob where you can't really tell where the particle is, as if such a concept of a single location even made sense.  The electrons' clouds on the outside of an atom all interpenetrate each other and really form a bigger cloud.  In fact, the concept of individual electrons is pretty thin; the electrons are so incestuous, you really can't separate any one from the group.  Until you have to.

<p>The nucleus, in the middle, is invisible, because it's 100,000 times smaller.  Even though, that's where almost all of the material and mass is.  It's another blobby cloud that's tiny relative to the electron blob.  THAT looks like a tiny, solid marble, from the point of view of the electron cloud.  The atom, with its electron cloud, in turn, looks like a tiny, solid marble compared to the size of a cell in a plant or animal, which is, in turn, 100,000 times bigger.  Which, of course, is invisible to us without a microscope, because it's 100,000 times smaller than we are.  The only way a quantum mechanical particle looks like a solid marble, is from a distance.  Quantum mechanics is the way things work close up, at tiny, tiny sizes.

<p>Four decades later, I realized, I'd been asking the wrong question.  Don't ask, why are microscopic particles so unintuitive?  Ask instead, why are they so unintuitive to me?  That's because I grew up with solid objects, with definite surfaces.  Wood and metal and plastic all have surfaces; they have different textures,  but their surface layers all seem infinitesimally thin, and mostly inflexible.  I'd wrap my fingers around them, follow the surfaces and edges with my fingers or toes, and put them in my mouth and feel them with my lips and tongue.  (I'm talking about, like, before kindergarten, when our perception of the world crystalizes.)  Even water has a surface, even when splashing around, even small droplets.  The few cloudy things, like real clouds, or steam or smoke, were a mystery that I couldn't touch.

<p>Four decades later, computer hardware had raced ahead of where it had been; Moore's Law had happened 20 times by then.  I was no longer limited by 1 second of computer time, or by what little could be done in 1 second, back then.  Back then, the only CPU the average person had was a calculator, rarely programmable.  Real computers were only owned by companies (or university departments) with sizable budgets.  Now days, we all have massive computer power in our pockets and laptops.  Back then, floating point arithmetic was done by microcode; basically a program inside the CPU to carry out all the steps.  Now days, we have separate FPUs that do the work with blinding speed, while the GPU does the graphics, and the CPU races through other tasks.  Back then, graphics required multi-thousand-dollar workstations or printers, driven by special software; most computers simply had none.  Now days, we have GPUs that can whip together complex 3d images at realtime animation speed.
