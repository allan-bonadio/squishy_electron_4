Potential Energy is the energy a particle has because of where it is, it's location, specifically, how high up it is.  You can think of your space as having hills and valleys.  If the particle is on a hill, it's got more potential energy than if it's in a valley.  If your particle rolls over to the side of the hill, the particle will roll down, and and go faster.  As it loses altitude, and potential energy, that energy will be converted to <a href=kinetic.html>Kinetic Energy</a>.
