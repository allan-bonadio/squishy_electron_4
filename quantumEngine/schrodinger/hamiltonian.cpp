/* ************************************************************ step functions
Each generation uses different functions to produce the next generation in a cycle.
There's 4 steps— steps —  of a cycle, and 6 buffers used, each holding alternately Real and Imag points.
buffers 0 and 1: real and imaginary, olds and hamiltonians from -2 and -1
buffers 2 and 3: real and imaginary, olds from -2 and -1, and hamiltonians from 0 and 1
buffers 4 and 5: averaged from 0&1, and 2&3

steps 0 and 1: calculate from -2 and -1 to store in 0 and 1
steps 2 and 3: calculate from -2 thru +1, to store in buffers 2 and 3,
step 4 then average 0&1 with 2&3 and put those in 4&5

Note that claiming borders in steps 2 & 3 claims in both 2&4 for real, 3&5 for imag
therefore there's 4 layers of edges but 6 real buffers (6 complex) in each cycle

maybe we allocate buffers in blocs of 6 * nPoints doubles, so they're easier to jump between
