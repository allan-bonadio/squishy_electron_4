Some Calculation/Grinder terms:

note: ‚àÜt is the user-visible time per frame period, larger.
dt is actually the individual time increment each time through Schrodinger
FP means frame period.

a Frame: is an amount of calculation correspoinding to one refresh of
the video display (or analogous). Doesn't have to be synchronized with the screen
refreshes, although it often is.  Just the amount of calculation done for it.  Typically
hundreds of steps, grinder.stepsPerFrame * 4?  Dynamically adjusted.

a Step: is a calculation to advance the model dt time.  Like, running
Schrodinger's eq once (although it's more complicated).

a Hit: advancement by dt of one of many parts of the calculation.  As of this
writing, there are four hits to a step: two Vischer real+imag, times two
Midpoint first+last.  All together, they advance one dt.  (May be for whole
buffer, or for just one segment)

a Point is one number in a buffer, one state of the qm system, and/or any
associated numbers in parallel buffers like voltage.

A step on a point is a step on a point.  A hit on a point is a hit on a point.

Some sortof overlapping terms on timing:

videoFP: video frame period is the period it takes the screen to do one
scan.  rAF calls you that often.  Often 16‚Öî or 20 ms.  Determined by the screen hardware and maybe some user settings.

chosenFP: period chosen from the 'frame rate' menu, which shows rates
as FP periods.  So user chooses 20 fps and the chosenFP would be 50ms.
chosenFP should be an even multiple of videoFP but isn't always.
