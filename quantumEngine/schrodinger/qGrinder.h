/* Some terms:
a Frame: is an amount of calculation correspoinding to one refresh of the display.
	Doesn't have to be synchronized with the screen refreshes; just the amount of
	calculation done for it.

a Step: is an mount of calculation to advance the model dt time.
	(Really ‚àÜt but it's tedious entering the delta character.)

a Hit: advancement by dt of one of many parts of the calculation.  As of this writing,
	there are four hits to a step: two split by the Vischer algorithm,
	and two split doing the Midpoint method.
