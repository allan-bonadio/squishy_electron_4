/* Some Calculation/Grinder terms:
a Frame: is an amount of calculation correspoinding to one refresh of
the video display. Doesn't have to be synchronized with the screen
refreshes; just the amount of calculation done for it.  Typically
hundreds of steps.

a Step: is an mount of calculation to advance the model ‚àÜt or dt time.

a Hit: advancement by dt of one of many parts of the calculation.  As of
this writing, there are four hits to a step: two Vischer real+imag, and
two Midpoint first+last.

Some sortof overlapping terms on timing:

videoFP: video frame period is the period it takes the screen to do one
scan.  rAF calls you that many times.  Often 16‚Öî or 20 ms.

chosenFP: period chosen from the 'frame rate' menu, which shows rates
not periods.  So user chooses 20 fps and the chosenFP would be 50ms.
chosenFP should be an even multiple of videoFP but isn't always.
