# To run all the tests, run it like this:
#    quantumEngine> make test

#    quantumEngine> testing/cppuRunner.sh
#
# To run under debugger:
#    quantumEngine> testing/cppuRunner.sh db

#    quantumEngine> testing/cppuRunner.sh db foo bar
#
# To run all tests whose Names include the string 'foo' and those including 'bar':
#    quantumEngine> testing/cppuRunner.sh foo bar
#
# To run all tests under Group(s), use this:
#    quantumEngine> testing/cppuRunner.sh -g foo -g bar
#
# to use any other cppuTest switches, do it like this
#    quantumEngine> testing/cppuRunner.sh -sn foo -xg bar
# see other switches https://cpputest.github.io/manual.html#command-line-switches
