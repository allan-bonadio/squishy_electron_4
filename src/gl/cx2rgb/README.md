Colors for Complex Numbers

# Color Hexagon

the 'color circle' hexagon:

	       green    yellow
	       
	cyan                        red
	
	       blue    magenta

Guns are constant 1 when angle is next to gun color.
2 guns are always nonzero unless you're exactly on a rgb color, when only that one is.
Each side also has a gradient, one other color that's increasing/decreasing.

0° = +1 = red

60° = .5 + sqrt3/2 i = yellow
120° = -.5 + sqrt3/2 i = green

180 = -1 = cyan = 0 1 1

-120° = -.5 + sqrt3/2 i = blue = 0 0 1
-60° = .5 - sqrt3/2 i = magenta = 1 0 1

0° = +1 = red

Note that the display numbers go to 1 whereas the complex y only goes to sqrt3/2

# Numbers
Complex = x + iy
I divide these to isolate just the phase.

Color = r g b

=x / (y + 1e-6)

I need a function that'll do a quarter.  Then just remap it around.
